# Skills

## Introduction

Skills are abilities that your character may acquire through training and experience. Skills have a value, and may have secondary benefits related to that value.

### Skill Use

Skills can be active or passive. While passive skills apply automatically, you may only use one active skill at a time.

### Skill Rolls

A skill roll is a roll of (3d6 + skill value + modifiers) > 10.
